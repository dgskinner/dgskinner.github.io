# Rattlesnake

Rattlesnake is a game based on the classic arcade game Snake.
The goal is to direct the snake toward the white squares (eggs).
* As in the classic game, the rattesnake grows with each egg eaten, making the game harder as it progresses.
* In my version of the game, the snake also drops a mine each time it eats an egg.
* The game ends once the snake runs into a mine or itself.
